        I am signing up on Replit's 100 days of python challenge!
        I will make sure to spend some time everyday coding along, for a minimum of ten minutes a day.
        I'll be using Rrplit's, an amazing online IDE so i can do this on my phone wherever i happen to be. No excuses for not coding from tge middle of a field.!""")
